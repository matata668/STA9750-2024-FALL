By their nature, restaurants generate significant food waste, and when sanitation practices are inadequate, they create ideal conditions for rats to thrive. This research examines the correlation between restaurant sanitation grades (B and C) and rat activity, as well as the influence of restaurant density on reported rat sightings across neighborhoods.\n\nThe study also explores the impact of outdoor dining, which expanded significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. While outdoor dining supported businesses, it may have inadvertently contributed to rat infestations by increasing food access and improperly managed waste. By analyzing trends in restaurant grades, density, and rat activity over time, we aim to determine whether outdoor dining has exacerbated the rat problem in certain areas.\n\nThrough this analysis, we seek to identify patterns and relationships that highlight how restaurant practices contribute to urban rat populations. These insights are critical for developing targeted interventions to mitigate rat infestations and improve public health across NYC neighborhoods.\n\n### Libraries used\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the code\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(geosphere)\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(geosphere)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggrepel) \nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Loading the necessary data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the code\"}\n# Get the current working directory\ncurrent_path <- getwd()\n\n# Define the 'data' directory path\ndata_directory <- file.path(current_path, \"Rat_Data\")\n\n# Check if the directory exists, and create it if it doesn't\nif (!dir.exists(data_directory)) {\n  success <- dir.create(data_directory, recursive = TRUE)\n  if (success) {\n    message(\"Directory 'Data' created successfully at: \", data_directory)\n  } else {\n    stop(\"Failed to create directory 'Data'.

By leveraging this data, we aim to analyze the prevalence and distribution of rat activity across various NYC neighborhoods.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nWe focus on inspection data from 2019, extracting relevant columns and combining the two data sets using zip codes as the common key for integration. The combined data is then cleaned and pre-processed to align with the requirements of our analysis.\n\n**Data Limitations**\n\nInspection Bias: The data set does not indicate the absence of rats in areas that were not inspected. This can create an illusion of lower rat activity in neighborhoods with fewer inspections. Similarly, areas with higher rates of active rat signs may reflect more frequent inspections rather than a genuinely higher rat population.\n\nMissing Data: A significant number of empty rows exist within the datasets, which necessitates careful and thorough cleaning to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis. By addressing these limitations and ensuring a robust data-cleaning process, we aim to produce meaningful insights into rat infestation patterns and their correlations with restaurant inspection data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the code\"}\n# Increase timeout limit to 300 seconds\noptions(timeout = 300)\n\n\n# Define output

more likely to experience elevated **rat sighting**, particularly in localized ZIP codes. Poor sanitation practices associated with lower restaurant grades likely contribute to rat infestations.\n\nTo address the limitations of missing data and analyze the relationship between poor restaurant sanitation and rat activity, we focused on restaurants with Grades B and C and rat density across ZIP Codes in the five boroughs of New York City: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.\n\n**Data Cleaning and Standardization**\n\n1. ZIP Code Validation:\n    The data was cleaned and standardized to ensure all ZIP Codes were valid and accurately mapped to their respective boroughs using a ZIP  \n    \n    Code-to-borough mapping file.\n\n2. Restaurant Sanitation Data:\n    \n   Restaurants receiving sanitation Grades B and C, which indicate lower sanitation standards, were filtered and counted for each ZIP Code.\n\n3. Rat Density Data:\n   Rat activity data was filtered to exclude inspections resulting in “Passed” or “Failed for Other R” outcomes. This provided a more      \n   reliable measure of rat activity by focusing on confirmed rodent sightings or infestations.\n\n**Merging and Analysis**\n\nThe cleaned restaurant sanitation data and rat density data were merged using ZIP Codes as the key. This integration allowed us to directly compare the number of restaurants with lower sanitation grades to rat activity within each ZIP Code.\n\nThis process ensured a comprehensive analysis of how poor sanitation practices in restaurants might correlate with increased rat infestations across New York City neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the code\"}\n# Step 1: Clean ZIP Codes and Map Boroughs -----------------------------------\nzipcode_mapping <- zipcode_mapping %>%\n  mutate(ZIPCODE = str_trim(as.character(Zipcode)),\n         BOROUGH = str_trim(as.character(Borough)))\n\n# Clean and map restaurant data\nrestaurants_clean <- restaurant_filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(ZIPCODE = str_trim(as.character(ZIPCODE)),\n         ZIPCODE = ifelse(str_length(ZIPCODE) == 5, ZIPCODE, NA)) %>%  #

Effective sanitation practices and targeted interventions in identified ZIP codes are critical to addressing this issue.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Outdoor dining and its impact on Rat infestation in NYC\n\nOutdoor dining in New York City became a significant part of the restaurant scene, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when it was rapidly expanded to allow restaurants to operate on sidewalks, streets, and other open spaces. While this initiative provided safer dining options and supported businesses, it also brought challenges related to sanitation and waste management. Food scraps, improperly stored trash, and debris from outdoor setups created an environment that attracted pests, particularly rats, leading to increased health code violations and rat sightings.\n\nTo analyze if outdoor dining has caused an increase in rat infestations, we will compare rat sightings near outdoor dining violations over time. By identifying outdoor seating violations and checking for rat inspections within a 100-meter radius, we can observe patterns and trends. Specifically, we will focus on the pandemic years (2020-2022) when outdoor dining expanded significantly, to determine if rat infestation rates increased in these areas compared to previous years.\n\n#### **Hypothesis**:\n\n-   The increase in outdoor seating violations after COVID (2020-2022) may have contributed to higher rat infestation rates. This could be due to improper waste management and sanitation practices around outdoor dining areas.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the code\"}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(geosphere)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\n# Filter rat inspections with valid lat/lon and failed results\nrats_filtered_loc <- rats_filtered_data %>%\n  filter(!is.na(LATITUDE) & !is.na(LONGITUDE) & RESULT != \"Passed\") %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = year(mdy_hms(INSPECTION_DATE)))\n\n# Extract outdoor seating violations from restaurants\noutdoor_seating <- restaurant_filtered_data %>%\n  filter(grepl(\"outdoor|seating|sidewalk\", `VIOLATION DESCRIPTION`, ignore.case = TRUE)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Latitude) & !is.na(Longitude)) %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = year(mdy(`INSPECTION DATE`)))\n\n# Select coordinates for rats and outdoor seating\noutdoor_coords <- outdoor_seating %>% \n  select(Latitude, Longitude) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(Latitude) & !is.na(Longitude)) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\nrat_coords <- rats_filtered_loc %>% \n  select(LATITUDE, LONGITUDE) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(LATITUDE) & !is.na(LONGITUDE)) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\n# Function to check for nearby rats (100 meters)\nfind_rats_nearby <- function(outdoor_coords, rat_coords, distance_threshold = 100) {\n  # Ensure both inputs are matrices with exactly two columns\n  rat_coords <- as.matrix(rat_coords[, c(1, 2)])\n  outdoor_coords <- as.matrix(outdoor_coords[, c(1, 2)])\n  \n  # Validate column names and types\n  if (ncol(rat_coords) != 2 | ncol(outdoor_coords) != 2) {\n    stop(\"Error: Inputs must have exactly two columns (latitude, longitude).\")\n  }\n  \n  result <- sapply(1:nrow(outdoor_coords), function(i) {\n    point <- outdoor_coords[i, ]  # Current restaurant coordinates\n    distances <- distHaversine(matrix(point, nrow = 1), rat_coords)  # Distance to all rat points\n    any(distances <= distance_threshold)  # TRUE if within threshold\n  })\n  return(result)\n}\n\n# Apply the corrected function\noutdoor_seating$RAT_INFESTATION_NEARBY <- find_rats_nearby(outdoor_coords, rat_coords)\n\n\n# Select specific columns\nselected_columns <- outdoor_seating %>%\n  select(\"DBA\",\"BORO\",\"ZIPCODE\", \"YEAR\",`VIOLATION CODE`, 'RAT_INFESTATION_NEARBY')\n\n# Print the selected columns\nkable(head(selected_columns, 6))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|DBA                           |BORO      | ZIPCODE| YEAR|VIOLATION CODE |RAT_INFESTATION_NEARBY |\n|:-----------------------------|:---------|-------:|----:|:--------------|:----------------------|\n|BLUESTONE LANE                |Manhattan |   10128| 2024|28-07          |TRUE                   |\n|STEVE'S ORIGINAL JERK CHICKEN |Brooklyn  |   11203| 2022|28-07          |TRUE                   |\n|G & S RESTAURANT              |Bronx     |   10466| 2024|28-07          |TRUE                   |\n|TWO BROTHERS FISH & CHIPS     |Brooklyn  |   11206| 2023|28-07          |TRUE                   |\n|ZOUJI BBQ                     |Queens    |   11355| 2024|28-07          |TRUE                   |\n|NIEVES TIA MIMI ICES          |Brooklyn  |   11220| 2024|28-07          |TRUE                   |\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the code\"}\n# Group by year and count rat infestations near outdoor seating violations\nrat_summary <- outdoor_seating %>%\n  filter(RAT_INFESTATION_NEARBY == TRUE) %>%\n  group_by(YEAR) %>%\n  summarise(Rat_Infestations = n())\n\n# Summarize total outdoor seating violations by year\noutdoor_summary <- outdoor_seating %>%\n  group_by(YEAR) %>%\n  summarise(Outdoor_Violations = n())\n\n# Combine the two summaries\ncombined_summary <- full_join(outdoor_summary, rat_summary, by = \"YEAR\") %>%\n  replace_na(list(Outdoor_Violations = 0, Rat_Infestations = 0))\n\n# Visualization --------------------------------------------------------------\nggplot(combined_summary, aes(x = YEAR)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = Outdoor_Violations, fill = \"Outdoor Violations\"), \n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Rat_Infestations, color = \"Rat Infestations\"), size = 1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Outdoor Violations\" = \"steelblue\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Rat Infestations\" = \"red\")) +\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 2020, xmax = 2022, ymin = 0, ymax = Inf), \n            fill = \"gray\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Impact of Outdoor Seating on Rat Infestation Rates\",\n       subtitle = \"Highlighted COVID Period (2020-2022)\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Count\",\n       fill = \"Legend\", color = \"Legend\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](individual_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### **Key Observations**:\n\n1.  **Outdoor Violations**:\n    -

Rats!!* ](https://www.eater.com/22828594/restaurants-more-rats-pandemic) \n\n**(Relevant article)**\n\nA report by Elazar Sontag in Eater (December 14, 2021) provides critical insights into the rise of rat infestations in New York City post-COVID-19, aligning with my findings on the impact of outdoor dining. The article shares a specific incident at a Brooklyn wine bar where an unusual smell was traced to something decaying beneath the outdoor dining structure, inaccessible without tearing up the entire parklet. This story highlights how outdoor dining setups, while beneficial for restaurants, inadvertently created new habitats for rats by providing shelter and easier access to food waste.\n\nI think we can all agree that during the peak of COVID-19 in 2020, rat populations initially declined due to the closure of restaurants, which limited food availability. Sontag’s article describes reports of starving rats resorting to cannibalism as food sources dwindled. However, the reopening of restaurants, particularly with outdoor dining spaces and street-side cooking, reversed this trend by creating an abundance of food once again. As a result, rats rapidly reappeared, with infestations increasing across neighborhoods.\n\nThis finding aligns with my analysis, which shows a notable correlation between rat activity and outdoor dining violations post-COVID. The lack of adequate waste management in outdoor setups further exacerbated the problem, leading to lawsuits demanding stricter sanitation measures and reconsideration of outdoor dining practices. The issue is not unique to NYC; cities like New Orleans, Chicago, and Los Angeles have reported unprecedented increases in rat sightings following the rise of outdoor dining. These observations emphasize the need for improved waste management strategies to address the unintended consequences of outdoor dining on urban rat infestations.\n\n#### **Learning**:\n\n-   **Post-COVID**: The rise/ existing in unauthorized outdoor dining, lack of proper waste management, street cooking, and similar activities have likely exacerbated rat infestations, emphasizing the importance of effective waste management.\n-   **Preventative Measures**: To mitigate rat infestations, stricter enforcement of sanitation protocols for outdoor seating areas is necessary, especially in periods of increased outdoor dining activity.\n\n#### **Conclusion**:\nWe can see a positive relationship between the increase in outdoor seating violations and rat infestation, particularly in 2024.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Restaurants: A Vital Part of NYC and Their Role in Rat Infestation\n\nRestaurants are a key part of NYC’s culture and economy, providing jobs, tourism, and vibrant dining spaces. However, poor sanitation and the rise of outdoor dining have contributed to rat infestations by increasing food waste and trash.\n\nNow, we will analyze the correlation between restaurant density and rat population across NYC boroughs. Higher restaurant density, especially those with poor grades (B and C), may attract and sustain larger rat populations, highlighting the connection between restaurant presence and rat infestations in NYC.\n\n#### **Hypothesis**:\n\n-   **Higher restaurant density contributes to increased rat activity** due to improper waste management, food availability, and urban environmental factors.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the code\"}\n# Step 1: Prepare ZIP Code Mapping -------------------------------------------\nzipcode_mapping <- zipcode_mapping %>%\n  mutate(ZIPCODE = str_trim(as.character(Zipcode)),\n         BOROUGH = str_trim(as.character(Borough)))\n\n# Step 2: Fill NA or Invalid BORO in Restaurant Data -------------------------\nrestaurant_filtered_zb <- restaurant_filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(ZIPCODE = str_trim(as.character(ZIPCODE)),  # Trim and convert ZIPCODE\n         BORO = ifelse(is.na(BORO) | BORO == \"0\", \n                       coalesce(zipcode_mapping$BOROUGH[match(ZIPCODE, zipcode_mapping$ZIPCODE)], BORO),\n                       BORO))\n\n# Step 3: Fill NA or Invalid BOROUGH in Rat Data -----------------------------\nrats_filtered_zb <- rats_filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(ZIP_CODE = str_trim(as.character(ZIP_CODE)),  # Trim and convert ZIP_CODE\n         BOROUGH = coalesce(zipcode_mapping$BOROUGH[match(ZIP_CODE, zipcode_mapping$ZIPCODE)], BOROUGH))\n\n\n# Step 2: Filter Rat Data for Rat Activity -----------------------------------\nrat_activity <- rats_filtered_zb %>%\n  filter(!RESULT %in% c(\"Passed\", \"Failed for Other R\")) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(LATITUDE) & !is.na(LONGITUDE)) %>%\n  group_by(BOROUGH) %>%\n  summarise(Rat_Activity_Count = n())\n\n# Step 3: Aggregate Restaurant Data by Borough ------------------------------\nrestaurant_density <- restaurant_filtered_zb %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Latitude) & !is.na(Longitude)) %>%\n  group_by(BORO) %>%\n  summarise(Restaurant_Count = n())\n\n# Step 4: Merge Data ---------------------------------------------------------\ndensity_data <- restaurant_density %>%\n  mutate(BORO = str_to_lower(str_trim(BORO))) %>%\n  inner_join(\n    rat_activity %>%\n      mutate(BOROUGH = str_to_lower(str_trim(BOROUGH))),\n    by = c(\"BORO\" = \"BOROUGH\")\n  )\n\n# Step 5: Visualization ------------------------------------------------------\n\nggplot(density_data, aes(x = Restaurant_Count, y = Rat_Activity_Count, label = BORO)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, color = \"blue\") +                               # Scatter points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = TRUE) +               # Trendline with confidence interval\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = paste0(BORO, \" (\", Restaurant_Count, \", \", Rat_Activity_Count, \")\")),\n                  size = 4, color = \"black\", box.padding = 0.5) +      # Add BORO and coordinates\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +                                 # Format y-axis as whole numbers\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma) +                                 # Format x-axis as whole numbers\n  labs(title = \"Density of Restaurants vs Rat Activity\",\n       subtitle = \"Analyzing Relationship Between Restaurants and Rat Infestation Rates\",\n       x = \"Number of Restaurants (Density)\",\n       y = \"Number of Rat Activity Inspections\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](individual_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### **Key Observations**:\n\n1.  **Positive Correlation**:\n    -   The graph shows a slight positive correlation between the **number of restaurants** (restaurant density) and the **number of rat activity inspections**.\n    -   Boroughs with higher restaurant density, such as **Manhattan** and **Brooklyn**, also exhibit higher rat activity inspections.\n2.  **Manhattan and Brooklyn**:\n    -   These boroughs have the **highest restaurant densities** (e.g., Manhattan: \\~94,661 restaurants) and **significant rat activity counts** (e.g., 136,963 inspections).\n    -   This suggests that areas with concentrated restaurant activity may experience increased rat infestations due to factors such as waste generation.\n3.  **Low-Density Areas**:\n    -   **Staten Island** has the lowest restaurant density (\\~9,218 restaurants) and rat activity inspections (\\~2,049). This aligns with the general trend that lower restaurant density areas tend to have lower rat activity.\n4.  **Outliers**:\n    -   The **Bronx** appears to have a higher number of rat activity inspections relative to its restaurant density (\\~23,274 restaurants, \\~96,498 inspections). This could indicate other contributing factors, such as waste management issues or urban infrastructure challenges.\n\n\n#### **Learning**:\n\n-   **Targeted Waste Management Policies**: Boroughs with higher restaurant density, like Manhattan and Brooklyn, require stricter waste management practices to mitigate rat infestations.\n-   **Further Investigation**: The Bronx's higher rat activity relative to restaurant density warrants further analysis into non-restaurant-related factors contributing to infestations.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Summary\n\nOur analysis demonstrates a clear relationship between rat infestations in NYC and factors such as poor sanitation, restaurant density, and the expansion of outdoor dining. We found that areas with higher concentrations of restaurants, particularly those with grades B and C, tend to experience increased rat activity. Poor waste management, exacerbated by outdoor dining setups, creates conditions that attract and sustain rat populations. Boroughs like Manhattan and Brooklyn, with the highest restaurant density, showed the strongest correlation with rat infestations.\n\n\n## **Limitations of Our Assumptions**\n\n1. Data Quality:\n    Our analysis relies on inspection data, which may not capture all instances of rat activity or sanitation violations. Underreporting or \n    delayed reporting could affect the results.\n2. Spatial Accuracy:\n    We assume a 100-meter radius for rat sightings around outdoor dining violations, which may not accurately reflect rats' mobility or the      true impact area.\n3. Causality vs. Correlation:\n    While we found correlations between restaurant density, sanitation, and rat activity, this does not prove direct causality. Other  \n    underlying factors might contribute to the observed patterns.\n4. COVID-19 Impact:\n   The unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as temporary outdoor dining policies and changes in waste management services,       could distort long-term trends.\n   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Proposal for Future Work\n\nOur analysis has revealed significant correlations between poor restaurant grades (B and C), rat activity, restaurant density, and the impact of outdoor dining on rat infestations across NYC neighborhoods. While these findings provide important insights, further work is needed to deepen our understanding and address limitations. Below are key proposals for future work:\n\n1. Borough-Level and Neighborhood-Specific Analysis\n\n  Conduct a detailed analysis at the borough and neighborhood levels to identify localized trends and specific hotspots. This will help target interventions in areas with the highest rat activity and poor restaurant sanitation.\n\n2. Comparison with Other Cities\n\n  Conduct a comparative analysis with data from other major cities to understand how NYC’s rat infestation problem aligns with or differs from similar urban areas. This can offer best practices for managing sanitation and rat control.\n\n3. Public Behavior and Policy Impact\n\n  Assess the role of public behavior (e.g., littering, improper waste disposal) and evaluate the effectiveness of existing sanitation policies. Surveys or community-level data can provide insights into how public education campaigns and enforcement influence rat activity.\n  \n4. Temporal Trends and Longitudinal Analysis\n\nExpand the analysis to include multi-year data to examine how rat activity changes over time, particularly before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Investigating seasonal trends will also help determine when rat infestations peak and how outdoor dining contributes to this cycle.\n",
