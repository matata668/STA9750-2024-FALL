# Do restaurants play a significant role in contribution to rat infestation?

New York City restaurant's persistent struggle with rat infestations has raised concerns about various contributing factors, particularly the role of restaurants. By their nature, restaurants generate significant food waste, and when sanitation practices are inadequate, they create ideal conditions for rats to thrive. This research examines the correlation between restaurant sanitation grades (B and C) and rat activity, as well as the influence of restaurant density on reported rat sightings across neighborhoods.

The study also explores the impact of outdoor dining, which expanded significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. While outdoor dining supported businesses, it may have inadvertently contributed to rat infestations by increasing food access and improperly managed waste. By analyzing trends in restaurant grades, density, and rat activity over time, we aim to determine whether outdoor dining has exacerbated the rat problem in certain areas.

Through this analysis, we seek to identify patterns and relationships that highlight how restaurant practices contribute to urban rat populations. These insights are critical for developing targeted interventions to mitigate rat infestations and improve public health across NYC neighborhoods.

```

**Data Sources and Rationale **

We are automating data analysis using two publicly available data sets from NYC Open Data:


- [DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/data) 

- [Rats activity recorded in restaurants by borough](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rats/idp8-qjf7)

We selected these datasets from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for detailed information on rat infestations. Using 2019 inspection data, we integrated and cleaned the data by zip codes to analyze rat activity across neighborhoods.

**Data Limitations**

Inspection Bias: Areas with fewer inspections may appear to have lower rat activity, while frequent inspections may inflate reported rat signs.
Missing Data: Significant gaps require careful cleaning to ensure accuracy.
Addressing these issues, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations with restaurant inspection data.

## Correlation between poor restaurant sanitation and increased rat activity

**Hypothesis:**
Boroughs with more Grade B and C restaurants are likely to have higher rat sightings, particularly in specific ZIP codes, due to poor sanitation practices contributing to infestations.

**Data Cleaning and Standardization**

1. ZIP Code Validation:
Ensured all ZIP codes were valid and mapped accurately to their respective boroughs using a ZIP-to-borough mapping file.

2. Restaurant Sanitation Data:
Filtered and counted restaurants with Grades B and C for each ZIP code as indicators of lower sanitation standards.

3. Rat Density Data:
Focused on confirmed rodent sightings, excluding inspections labeled “Passed” or “Failed for Other R” for reliability.

**Merging and Analysis**
Using ZIP codes as the key, restaurant sanitation data and rat density data were merged to analyze correlations between lower sanitation grades and rat activity across NYC neighborhoods. This process provided a clear view of how poor restaurant practices may drive rat infestations.

#### Key Observations
1. Bronx:

ZIP codes 10457 and 10458 show high rat sightings (12,000+) and a significant number of Grade B and C restaurants, indicating a clear link between poor sanitation and rat activity.
2. Brooklyn:

ZIP codes 11215 and 11222 have the highest rat activity (20,000+), clustering in areas with many lower-graded restaurants, suggesting localized waste management issues.

3. Manhattan:

* ZIP codes 10013 and 10036 have the most Grade B and C restaurants (600+) but moderate rat sightings, indicating better urban management.

4. Queens:

ZIP codes 11385 and 11373 show high rat sightings and concentrations of lower-graded restaurants, with peaks in specific areas.

5. Staten Island:

* Lowest rat activity overall. ZIP code 10301 has the highest sightings (600) but fewer lower-graded restaurants compared to other boroughs.

### Learnings

1. Localized Rat Clusters: Rat activity is concentrated in specific ZIP codes, like 10457 (Bronx) and 11215 (Brooklyn).
2. Borough-Specific Trends:
*Bronx/Brooklyn: Stronger links between rat sightings and lower-graded restaurants.
* Manhattan: Moderate rat activity despite high restaurant density.
* Staten Island: Consistently low rat activity, indicating better sanitation.
3. Targeted Interventions: Focus on ZIP codes with many Grade B and C restaurants to improve sanitation and reduce rat activity.

###Conclusion

The analysis shows a positive correlation between lower-graded restaurants and rat activity, particularly in Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. Targeted sanitation efforts in high-risk ZIP codes are essential to mitigate the problem.

## Restaurants: A Vital Part of NYC and Their Role in Rat Infestation

Restaurants are essential to NYC’s economy and culture, but poor sanitation and outdoor dining have increased food waste, fueling rat infestations. This analysis examines the link between restaurant density, particularly lower-graded ones (B and C), and rat populations across NYC boroughs.

#### **Hypothesis**:

* Higher restaurant density leads to increased rat activity due to improper waste management, food availability, and urban factors.

```

#### **Key Observations**:

1.  **Positive Correlation**:
    * A slight positive correlation exists between restaurant density and rat activity inspections, with higher densities seen in Manhattan and Brooklyn correlating to increased rat activity.
    
2.  **Manhattan and Brooklyn**:
    * These boroughs have the highest restaurant densities (e.g., Manhattan: ~94,661 restaurants) and significant rat activity (e.g., ~136,963 inspections), suggesting waste generation contributes to infestations.
3.  **Low-Density Areas**:
    * Staten Island has the lowest restaurant density (~9,218 restaurants) and rat inspections (~2,049), aligning with the trend of lower density leading to lower rat activity.
    
4.  **Outliers**:
    * The Bronx shows disproportionately high rat activity (~96,498 inspections) relative to its restaurant density (~23,274 restaurants), suggesting other factors like waste management or infrastructure issues.

#### **Learning**:

* Improved Waste Management: High-density areas like Manhattan and Brooklyn need stricter waste management to control rat infestations.

* Further Analysis: The Bronx’s elevated rat activity requires investigation into non-restaurant-related factors.

## Outdoor dining and its impact on Rat infestation in NYC


Outdoor dining in NYC, expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, boosted businesses but led to sanitation issues, such as food scraps and poorly stored trash, attracting rats and increasing health violations. To evaluate its impact, we analyzed rat sightings within a 100-meter radius of outdoor dining violations from 2020-2022, comparing trends to pre-pandemic years.

#### **Hypothesis**:

* Increased outdoor dining violations post-COVID (2020-2022) contributed to higher rat infestation rates due to improper waste management and sanitation practices.

#### **Key Observations**:

1.  **Outdoor Violations**:
    * Outdoor seating violations increased steadily from 2022, peaking in 2024.
2.  **Rat Infestation Rates**:
    * Rat infestations near outdoor violations showed a consistent rise, spiking in 2023 and 2024, indicating a clear correlation.
3.  **COVID Period (2020-2022)**:
    * During COVID (2020-2022), both outdoor violations and rat infestations were lower, with a sharp increase observed post-2022.

    
#### ["The new Normal, *Ah!! Rats!!* ](https://www.eater.com/22828594/restaurants-more-rats-pandemic) 

**(Relevant article)**

Elazar Sontag’s Eater report (Dec 14, 2021) highlights rising rat infestations in NYC post-COVID-19, aligning with my findings. A Brooklyn wine bar incident revealed outdoor dining structures create rat habitats by providing shelter and food access.

During COVID-19 restaurant closures in 2020, rat populations declined due to limited food. However, the reopening of outdoor dining and street-side cooking reversed this trend, leading to increased infestations. My analysis also shows a strong correlation between outdoor dining violations and rat activity post-2020.

Similar trends in cities like New Orleans, Chicago, and Los Angeles stress the need for better waste management.

#### **Learning**:

*  **Post-COVID**:Poor waste management and outdoor dining worsened rat infestations.

*   **Preventative Measures**: Stricter sanitation enforcement is necessary.

#### **Conclusion**:

Outdoor dining violations strongly correlate with rising rat infestations, especially by 2024.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

Our analysis shows a strong link between rat infestations in NYC and factors such as poor sanitation, restaurant density, and outdoor dining expansion. Areas with higher concentrations of Grade B and C restaurants—particularly in boroughs like Manhattan and Brooklyn—experience elevated rat activity. Poor waste management, worsened by outdoor dining setups, creates ideal conditions for rat populations to thrive.

## **Limitations of Our Assumptions**

1. Data Quality:
    Inspection data may underreport rat activity or delays in reporting
    
2. Spatial Accuracy:
    A 100-meter radius around outdoor violations may not fully reflect rats' range.
    
3. Causality vs. Correlation:
    Observed links may involve other contributing factors.

4. COVID-19 Impact:

   Temporary policies and altered waste management may distort long-term trends.

1. **Local Analysis**: Conduct borough- and neighborhood-level studies to identify hotspots for targeted interventions.

2. **City Comparisons**: Compare data with other cities to adopt best practices for rat control and sanitation.
3. **Behavior & Policy Impact**: Evaluate public behavior and sanitation policies through surveys to measure their effectiveness.
  
4. **Longitudinal Trends**: Analyze multi-year and seasonal data to assess changes in rat activity, especially pre- and post-COVID.
