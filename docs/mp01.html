<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hi there, in this project we focus on the usage of <strong>Public Transit System</strong> usage across the various metro areas of the United States. To make the proper analysis we extracted the data from <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">The National Transit Database</a>.Leveraging data sets that track key metrics such as passenger trips, vehicle revenue miles (VRM), total fares, and operational expenses, the project provides insights into how public transportation systems adapted during unprecedented times such as COVID. One key area of exploration is the significant change in ridership due to direct and indirect factors experienced and by major transit systems, such as New York City’s subway, comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. The analysis uncovers changes in transit system performance, farebox recovery ratios, and usage patterns, offering a comprehensive view of the transportation landscape. Through data-driven exploration, the project aims to provide transit authorities, policymakers, and the public with actionable insights on the resilience and challenges faced by public transportation during a global health crisis.</p>
<p>Let us begin with downloading, cleaning, and joining tables from the various data we have found in the data set.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The transit system with the highest total fares per VRM is operated by Chicago Water Taxi (Wendella) in Ferryboat mode, with total fares of 237.46 per vehicle revenue mile.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The most efficient transit system in the country can vary depending on how “efficiency” is defined. Based on the analysis of farebox recovery, expenses per UPT, and expenses per VRM, I would consider New Mexico Department of Transportation’s Vanpool system in Las Cruces, NM, to be the most efficient in terms of operational cost efficiency (with the lowest expenses per VRM at $0.34). However, if we prioritize revenue efficiency, the Chicago Water Taxi (Wendella) emerges as the most efficient with the highest fares per VRM ($237.46), indicating a strong ability to generate revenue relative to its operational distance.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the choice of the most efficient system depends on whether cost minimization or revenue generation is considered more important for the definition of efficiency.</p>
